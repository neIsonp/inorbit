The Weekly Goal Tracker is a project that allows users to set and track their goals, monitoring progress on a weekly basis. This project was developed during the **Next Level Week (NLW)** event by **Rocketseat**.

**Objectives**: The main goals of this application were to train the use of the following tools/technologies:

- Developing a back-end with `Node.js`, using the Fastify framework
- Building a REST API and integrating `DrizzleORM` with `PostgreSQL`
- Validating data with `Zod`
- Containerizing the application using `Docker`
- Creating a responsive front-end with `ReactJS` and `TailwindCSS`
- Handling asynchronous data with `TanStack Query`
- And more...
